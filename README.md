# üíß Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the **potability of water** (whether it is safe for drinking) using **Machine Learning** classification algorithms such as **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**. The goal is to use physicochemical parameters like pH, hardness, solids, and conductivity to predict water quality efficiently and accurately.

## üß† **Abstract**
Water quality is a critical environmental issue that affects human health. Traditional methods for determining water quality are often time-consuming and prone to human error.  
This project applies **Machine Learning techniques** to automate and improve the accuracy of water quality predictions using the **Water Potability dataset**.  
Algorithms such as **Logistic Regression** and **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** are implemented, compared, and evaluated for their accuracy and efficiency.

## üéØ **Objectives**
- Predict whether a given water sample is potable or not.  
- Apply classification algorithms to analyze physicochemical properties of water.  
- Evaluate and compare performance metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall**.

## üß© **Proposed Approach**
1. **Data Collection:**  
   Water potability dataset containing pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, and conductivity values.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handling missing and null values  
   - Removing duplicates and outliers  
   - Normalizing features for uniform scaling  

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Split data into training and testing sets  
   - Train models using:
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
   - Evaluate model accuracy and visualize results.

4. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Accuracy Score  
   - Graphical analysis using heatmaps, boxplots, and scatter plots
